This project was pulled from a Kaggle dataset, which was originally obtained from the UCI Repository. 
I focused on using linear and logistic regression, especially because it was a relatively small, clean dataset. 

Algorithms Used:
- Regression
  - Linear 
  - Logistic 
  - Support Vector Machine
- Classifier
  - Random Forest

Results : 
Accuracy Rate
- 57% using Linear
- 93% using Logistic
- 58% using Support Vector Machine (Linear)
- 90% using Random Forest
