This project was pulled from a Kaggle dataset, which was originally obtained from the UCI Repository. 
I focused on using linear and logistic regression, especially because it was a relatively small, clean dataset. 

Algorithms Used:
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- SVM Regression

Results : 
- 93% Accuracy Rate using logistic regression.
